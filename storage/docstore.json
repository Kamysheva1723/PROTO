decided to \ndispose of the Brent Spar, a redundant oil storage buoy, by sinking it a deep water site \nin the North Atlantic. This reopened an extensive debate on the whole question of the \ndisposal of redundant oil and gas installations in European waters, of which there are \napproximately 600. The decision coincided with the North Sea Conference and in the \nsubsequent Ministerial Declaration a majority of the Ministers present, including the \nCommissioner, but excluding the UX and Norwegian Ministers who represent the \nonly two states with a significant number of large installations which under existing \nguidelines can be considered for sea disposal, effectively called for a complete ban on \ndisposal at sea of all such installations, in order to protect the marine environment. \nThe Urcnt Spar 'affair' generated considerable public interest and dcmonstrated the \ndiflicuities of implcmcnling a disposal policy which does not have sufficiently broad \nsupport. Eventually, in the face of a concerted campaign, which included a consumer \nboycott of Shell products in several Member States Shell reversed its decision and the \nBrent Spar was towed to a Norwegian fjord pending a further review of all the options \nfor disposal. Following this detailed review in January 1998 Shell announced that they \nwere now seeking approval from the UK to scrap the topsides onshore and dismantle \nand reuse the hull as part of a quay extension in Norway. Since then the issue has been \nextensively debated within OSPAR and the discussion on disposal of such \ninstallations continues and a Decision on the Prevention, Reduction and Control of \nPollution from the Disposal of Disused Offshore Installations under the Convention \nfor the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic (1992 \nOSPAR' Convention) is scheduled for adoption by a Ministerial Meeting of the \nConvention to be hekl in Portugal in July 1998. Major differences still exist but there \nis a general agrcemcnl that the consultation process, the failings of which were a \nfactor in the Brent Spar affair, needs improvement and that concrete installations need \nto be dealt with separately. These and other key issuss are currently being discussed in \ndetai!. \n1. Background \n1.1. At the June 1995 North Sea Conference the Commission took the position that \nthe prsferred disposal method for offshore oil and gas installations was to reuse or to \nbring them to shore for recycling and for disposal of unavoidable wastes. \n1 In this Communication, references to OSPAR are references to the Convention for the \nPrevention of Marine Poliution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft ('Oslo Convention'), \nsigned in Oslo on 15 February 1972 and, when it enters into force, to its successor, the \nConvention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic, signed in \nParis on 9 September 1992, as well as to the executive Commissions set up under these \nConventions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3048, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a68a5d99-79d9-4cb7-a770-212d1f673b07": {"__data__": {"id_": "a68a5d99-79d9-4cb7-a770-212d1f673b07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "57e79d51-5466-49bb-8825-bbb66d58872b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e93c81522dbd8753785acf5b6de8c9a9876737a968325af443ec88404a04203a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3050a2af-8248-409d-8383-7dd97f9490b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c134e7837d5461e97863458c01492d38aeb8dfabcc71f7244a2993508da2e987", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cf6d7a20-bf94-4dda-aa7b-c3b047bc7eb8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f0d12f42c742fc59a1d04f4577b98b2d7e40a51726fa232f9f7c33c73033233", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Commission therefore signed the Ministerial Declaration calling for such \ndisposal, inviting the contracting parties to the Oslo and Paris Convention for the \nProtcction of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic (which includes the \nNorth Sea in the Convention Area) ('OSPAR') to implement this by 1997. The UK \nand Norway dissented whilst France declared that it understood the Declaration as \napplying to sleel structures. \n1.2. At the subsequent OSPAR Commission Meeting a decision was adopted on a \nmajority basis establishing a moratorium on disposal at sea pending the adoption of a \nnew Decision on disposal. The UK and Norway opted out of this Decision whilst \nFrance maintained its position taken at the North Sea Conference. This Decision is \nnow under discussion in OSPAR with strenuous efforts being directed at arriving at a \nunanimous position. \n1.3. The Commission Services commissioned a joint study by a reputable offshore \nengineering company into the technical, environmental and economic aspects of \nremoval and disposal of such installations. This study was completed in November \n1996 and the report2 was distributed to and discussed with Member States and EEA \nMembers, environmental non governmental organisations and industry. It was also \ndistributed to the Contracting Parties of OSPAR to assist in their discussions. \n1.4. The main impetus for the study came from the 'Brent Spar' incident and the \nNorth Sea Conference Ministerial Declaration in June 1995. Clearly this was an issue \nwith implications for the Community and with no agreement between the states \ninvolved it was considered advisable to have a Ihorough technical review prepared in \norder to assist the Commission, and other interested parties - for the study has been \nmade widely available - to assess the best course of action on the basis of a thorough \nknowledge of the issues in question. \n1.5. The study arrived at two main sets of conclusions. For the large concrete \ninstallations complete removal is technically unproven, unlikely to provide \nenvironmental benefit and impossible to put a cost on at this stage. For the remainder \n(i.e. steel structures) except for a limited number of installations, complete removal is \ntechnically feasible and economically balanced when the total cost of removing all the \ninstallations is considered as a whole and could be safely undertaken. \n1.6. For all disposal options, the environmental impact of residues of toxic or \nhazardous substances on the environment can be reduced to acceptable levels \nprovided that these are contained, removed and disposed of carefully. Complete \nremoval and disposal on land would ensure that the steel could be recycled. It is \nfurlhermore self-cvidcnt that dcpcnding on the removal and disposal options chosen, \nthcrc could bc subslanlial amounts ofdemolition wastc and debris left on the seabed \nat the site of the installation and at a possible disposal site. \n2 A Technical Review of the possible Methods of Decommissioning and Disposing of Offshore \nOil and Gas installations - John Brown bv", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3090, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf6d7a20-bf94-4dda-aa7b-c3b047bc7eb8": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf6d7a20-bf94-4dda-aa7b-c3b047bc7eb8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "28f77c07-340b-4887-8ec3-ee58cdbdfe41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "8b1eb82e9c69cc8ae5fb073901403aec6176313970c0e7e93f0c08c90fd71493", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a68a5d99-79d9-4cb7-a770-212d1f673b07", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "1f08ff491ac16b285ab21efc543bf3ea631e401d184d3d9f4df456de5ae7653c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad62f4ed-e394-4dff-b9cf-4031f34623d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b44e063302807f30b2bd6e4639f72fc9f45b56459f89ba746707187e7226b9bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1.7. The overall extra costs imposed by bringing all steel platforms to shore for \nrecycling rather than implementing only the bare minimum 'required' by the \nInternational Maritime Organisation ('IMO') Regulations were estimated at up to 2 \nBECU over 25 years, or on the average up to about 80 MECU/year. The impact of \nsuch a decision on the overall production costs of oil and gas would be negligible \nalthough thc cost diffcrcntial for ccrtain individual installations could be substantial \nfor the operator concerned. (see also section 4.3) \n1.8. In European waters there are currently approximately 600 installations. Precise \nfigures are difflcult to give because of the range of definitions of what constitutes a \nparticular installation - for example where two platforms are connected by a fixed \nbridge and some installations are on the boundaries of the weight and water depth \nlimits. However it is generally agreed that of the 600 there are about 100 large steel \ninstallations and about 20 large concrete installations which fall into the category \nwhere at present partial removal is permitted under the guidelines established by the \nIMO to ensure the safety of navigation. These guidelines cover only removal, they do \nnot deal vvith any questions concerning disposal. The large steel installations are \nlocated mainly in UK (about 60) and Norwegian (about 30) waters. Currently a few \n(about 10 in total) are located in Irish, Italian and Spanish waters. As new discoveries \nare made the numbers may of course increase. The 100 steel installations represent \nabout 85% of the total mass of steel in the North Sea off-shore installations. Large \nconcrete installations are currently only present in UK and Norwegian waters. \n2. International Legislation \n2.1. There is a considerable body of International Law (Regional and Global \nConventions and Guidelines), EC and domestic legislation covering the removal and \ndisposal of disused olTshore oil and gas installations.

In sonie cases the queslion of removal is dealt with separately from disposal, \nothers which deal wilh disposal must by implication also cover removal. It should be \nnoted that as a gencral rule these internalional and regional conventions and \nguidelines deal only with minimum standards and individual states may impose more \nstringent conditions. \n2.3. The original Geneva Convention called for complete removal, but UNCLOS \n(which has not yet been ratified by all signatories) maintained the requirement of \nremoval as the main rule, but introduced the possibility of partial removal and hence \neffectively some disposal at sea. In connection with partial removal, UNCLOS \nrequires that guidelines established by the IMO to ensure the safety of navigation be \ntaken into account. \n2.4. The LC covers disposal by dumping in the sea, and allows for oil installations \nto be considered for disposal of in the sea on the basis of a case by case evaluation. It \nalso rcquires a pcrmil to dump to be refused if opportunities exist to re-use, recycle or \ntreat the waste without undue risks to human health or the environment or \ndisproportionate costs. \n2.5. The IMO Guidelines define mainly technical criteria (water depth and weight \ncriteria) for platforms which may be considered for only partial removal and specifies \nthe necessary water clearance after partial removal to ensure the safety of navigation. \nThe key criteria for such consideration is that the installations must be either in more \nthan 75m of water or must weigh more than 4 000 tonnes. A recommendation to the \nLondon Convention's Scientific Group that these guidelines should be reviewed will \nbe considered by the Consultative Committee of Contracting Parties in November. \n2.6. The Basel Convention deals with transboundary movements of hazardous \nwaste and their disposal. The Community is a Party to it and so are the Member \nStates. Although this Convention does not contain any specific provisions on the \ndisposal of offshore installations nor on disposal of waste at sea, it does require \nParties to ensure that the generation of hazardous waste is reduced to a minimum and \nthat where the generation of hazardous wastc cannot be avoided its environmentally \nsound management is guaranteed. \n2.7. A series of regional seas Conventions dealing with maritime environmental \nprotection lay down requirements for installations in particular seas. The European \nCommunity is a party to the Helsinki Convention, which covers the Baltic and \nrequires complete removal and disposal on land, and to the Barcelona Convention \nwhich covers the Mediterranean sea and reiterates the requirements in UNCLOS. \nFinally the European Community is a signatory and about to become party to the \nOSPAR Convention.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2952, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c92c98b-d9c2-4ffb-b349-c5edf9a5e6c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c92c98b-d9c2-4ffb-b349-c5edf9a5e6c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49d33e0e-5a0c-478d-a0ee-0e77d623fa18", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "b773a53b88782699f7145a58eaa29ecbfb86068fe1d46c6b8e087b5762be4002", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad62f4ed-e394-4dff-b9cf-4031f34623d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "cb27a824dca452beef4c5763a781597864d23c0252329bf2444bb265e976e061", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "647a0424-95a1-477d-b5fd-4b0037fe0be3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec1202cd1f25913259c74b1edcd6d5537f8b5343318811714f0fac3591eb8930", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "2.8.

The significant \nareas of disagreement are as follows, and are to a certain extent interdependent: \nThe structure of the Decision - While the UK and Norway favour a general \nauthorisation of consideration of sea disposal combined with a list of categories of \ninstallations for which such disposal is prohibited (prohibition list), the other \nContracting Parties favour a Decision based on a general prohibition of dumping with \na list of installations which may nevertheless be considered for sea disposal (reyerse \nlist). However, recent UK Ministerial statements suggest that the UK will eventually \naccept the reverse list approach, if sufficient progress can be made on other areas of \nthe draft currently being discussed. \n3 Ref. to OJ \n10", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2777, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "647a0424-95a1-477d-b5fd-4b0037fe0be3": {"__data__": {"id_": "647a0424-95a1-477d-b5fd-4b0037fe0be3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f670572f-e567-40e0-bc5f-e99ffeb7b30e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "d71b03609220bf57a9c070eec6332bb950ab3513809e56fed61b36d11268aa8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c92c98b-d9c2-4ffb-b349-c5edf9a5e6c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "98acbd1afeebe6b185f5f12379c642e579944c31238843c8a1d14c7883b52eda", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0bc3985-040e-4ec5-a982-3c6646bfa1d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d3774836be34c26a3f2175865dbe41f69cb1daf6501d4f8b6985774802021a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The question of an exception clause - The UK and Norway have proposed that their \n'prohibition lisf approach be complemenled by an exception clause which would \npermit in certain circumstanccs the installations on the prohibition list lo also be \nconsidered for sea disposal. They have also proposed that should the 'reverse list' \napproach be adopted it too should be complemented by an exception clause which \nwould permit those installations nol identified on the reverse list to be considered for \nsea disposal. The other Contracting Parties appear to question the real need for such \nan exception clause, particularly under the prohibition list approach and the possible \ncriteria for establishing such exceptions are in any case not agreed. \nThe definition of the technical characteristics of the categories of (large steel) \ninstallations for which the decision would allow consideration of sea disposal. The \nUK and Norway wish to ensure that all installations which are not required to be \ncomplctely removed under the IMO guideline may be considered for disposal at sea. \nThe other Contracting Parties appear to wish to prchibit disposal of steel installations \nor restrict the number which may be considered for sea disposal by introducing \nstrictcr technical criteria than the IMO removal Guidelines. \nFuture installations - The IMO guidelines distinguish between existing installations \nand those made after 1 January 1998 only to the extent that the water depth criteria is \nincreased from 75m to 100m and that these new installations must be designed in such \na way that they are capable of being removed. The UK and Norway appear to wish to \nreplicate this treatment in the OSPAR Decision whereas the remaining Contracting \nPartics appear to be seeking to ensure that these future installations are all disposed of \non land. Given the requirement to design new installations as removable, which has in \nany case been required by some states for many years, it would appear preferable if \nthe Decision were to make land disposal mandatory for all new installations. \nHowcver, given the timescale of developing, exploiting and exhausting reservoirs any \nnew installations are unlikely to be candidates for decommissioning for many years. \nConsultation - There is broad agreement that any proposed permit for disposal at sea \nshould be the subject of consultation. Howevcr, the amount of time permitted for \nconsultation, and in particular the possibility for consultative meetings of the \nContracting Parties and both industry and environment NGOs, in all cases where sea \ndisposal is being proposed, as well as the amount of information made available to the \nContracting Parties being consulted is not yet agreed. The UK and Norway appear to \nhave been in favour of less extensive consultation than the other Contracting Parties, \nbut it now seems likely that unanimous agreement on the form of consultation may be \nreached. \nThe criteria for installations that may be considered for disposal at sea are significant \nbecause the discussions are moving towards a position whereby some installations \nwould always be required to go to land, and some could be considered for sea disposal \non a case by case basis. How many of these 'IMO' large steel installations should be \nconsidered on a case by case basis is fundamental to the decision. Possible solutions \nto the impasse could include retaining the IMO criteria, setting new ones, or side-\nstepping the issue by prohibiting sea disposal of all installations and concentrating on \nthe exception clause. \n11", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3574, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0bc3985-040e-4ec5-a982-3c6646bfa1d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0bc3985-040e-4ec5-a982-3c6646bfa1d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "069bc390-7751-4462-897f-c012e61652c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "09bd1a0bf2dd83ccec9810256597b07c14c28a0fc54dab335010b0c9a5004c39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "647a0424-95a1-477d-b5fd-4b0037fe0be3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "cbf69d1444c8c80c5fca091fcb57525d65412157d9cd95aecbb79f345b56575e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e767d94-3272-47d8-aa1b-f24659959501", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a28febfa8c141519cc2e1b83476f9306f15e52980c14d8c43126309b1e937cb4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "3.3.

However, there are still major areas of disagreement over the form and \ncontent of the draft decision. \n3.5. The Decision is expected to be agreed at the OSPAR Ministerial Meeting in \nJuly 1998. By that time the OSPAR Convention should have entered into force. In the \nevent that the new Convention is not ratified, adoption of a Decision would formally \nbe by the Oslo Convention where the European Community is an observer. \n4. Additional issues to be considered when assessing options \nIn addition to the lcchnical and cnvironmental issues outlined above the following \npoints are also highly relevant -\n4.1. Member States \n4.1.1. Removal and disposal costs are met initially by the owners of the installations, \nthe oil companies, which in some instances have an element of state participation. \nBecause such expenditure is to a large extent tax- deductible, Member States may \nthemselves have to fund indirectly a part of the costs via reduced tax revenues. For \nexarnple, the estimated cost to the UK, which is the Member State which could be \nmost substantially affected by any tightening up of existing rules, is up to 70% of any \nadditional removal and disposal costs. \n4.1.2. The UK currently has the majority of the larger steel installations but more \nMember States could be materially affected in the future if they establish significant \noffshore oil and gas exploration and production. The UK has appeared to be strongly \nin favour of adopting a case by case approach and would probably give greater \nemphasis to a cost benefit or cost effectiveness analysis of the disposal options than \nother Member States with such installations. \n12", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2469, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e767d94-3272-47d8-aa1b-f24659959501": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e767d94-3272-47d8-aa1b-f24659959501", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "264d6bf4-5b89-4916-a998-6b6408227ed6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "492a763d35d4d465e0d121f2cbc6737772f6733d9ddaf7fa9e2b65bb323dc4fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0bc3985-040e-4ec5-a982-3c6646bfa1d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "8dc91a8a2c2968808b2bf9021f6d1cf911f1caed43d6b56bfc4ffed16d74755c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f1e16b97-828f-4447-b584-ba7837cb73ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "775cbc397e3236984a4816c95ccb3a059224eda248d820e2a2bade8354147d3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4.2. Norway \n4.2.1. Norway is the other country which currently could be substantially affected \nand as an EEA meinber would eventually be subject to Communily legislation. \nCurrently Norway takes a similar approach 10 the UK on the decision process \nalthough because the Norwegian state share of the costs is met by an actual cash \npayment to the owner (based on the tax history of the oil or gas field in question) \napproval by the Storting, the Norwegian Parliament, is required. The possible \nfmancial effects would therefore be reflected by an increase in public expenditure \nrather than in the UK case by a decrease in tax revenues. \n4.3. Industry \n4.3.1. The exploration and production industry is strongly opposed to any change in \nthe current case by case approach, particularly with regard to the larger installations \nwhich they consider to include all the 100 or so installations which are not required to \nbe completely removed under the IMO Guidelines. Initially technical feasibility was \nstressed as the most importanl factor but increasingly additional costs and safety \nfaclors compared to environmental gains have been emphasised by the industry. Their \nassociation Is & P Forum has chailenged some of the general cost estimates contained \nin John Brown's Technical Review as not being representative of individual cases and \nhave quoted the results of studies relating to two individual installations which were \nsignificantly higher than the John Brown estimates. The offshore contracting industry \non the other hand has consistently argued that all the steel structures can be safely \nremoved but have maintained a slightly lower profile. Their association IPLOCA did \nnot challenge the cost estimates when they provided their comments on the John \nBrown Technical Review. \n4.3.2. The fishing industry's association Europeche's policy is to call for the \ncomplete removal of all installations when they are decommissioned. The fishing \nindustry has traditionally been concerned that offshore exploration and production \ncould affect fishing opportunitics through pollution, by restricting the area available \nfor lishing and by installations giving rise to damage to fishing gears. \n4.4. Environmcntal Non-Governmental Organisations \n4.4.1. Environmental groups remain strongly in favour of bringing the steel \ninstallations to shore for recycling and/or disposal although their attitude towards \nconcrete installations has been somewhat modified. Much emphasis is placed on the \nduty to take a precautionary approach given the uncertainties of sea disposal and on \nthe difficulty of justifying what is seen as an exceptionally favourable treatment of the \noil and gas industry as regards their waste. This is particularly so given the trend in \ninternational and EC law is towards less, rather than more, disposal of wastes in the \nsea. \n13", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2863, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1e16b97-828f-4447-b584-ba7837cb73ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1e16b97-828f-4447-b584-ba7837cb73ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bf5e57c-9741-42aa-b8e0-3c31903f503f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "ef04904ac67e813d46035a3b6844cb85ba02f39648066fe08126109d2b43c823", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e767d94-3272-47d8-aa1b-f24659959501", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "4694ebde6865819886dd2e6f8efeb3d20c8780cadcdd7344b2e04e5457a0c502", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "13a22a91-48f5-49b0-8fa7-072e080e2939", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37cd3d9d8bd7a2a5142d12a5da0a1b0cc99560e2987d7db80cb8deeb8769fdf3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4.5. Qucstions relating to liability for abandoned or dumped installatioris \n4.5.1. Although UNCLOS is silent on thc question of liability, the 1989 1MO \nGuidelines and the 1996 Protocol to thc London Convention 1972 require Contracting \nParlies to address Ihc question of liability. For cxample, the IMO guidelines require \ncoastal Stales to ensure that Ihc legal title to installations and structures which have \nnot bcen entirely removed from the sea bed is unambiguous and that responsibility for \nmaintenance and the financial ability to assume liability for future damages are clearly \nestablished. \n4.5.2. It is likely that, in most cases, liability will remain with the original owner of \nthe installation. For example, the UK's consultative document \"Guidance Notes for \nIndustry - Abandonment of offshore Installations and Pipelines under the Petroleum \nAct 1987 (1995) recognised that abandonment would not normally involve a change \nin ownership and therefore the residual liability for any compensation or damages \nremained with the original owners in perpetuity. Although such an approach is in \naccordance vvith the polluter pays principle, perpetual liability raises a number of \nissues of concern, principally whether such owners can be effectively called to \naccount if damage is caused in the future. \n4.5.3. An alternative approach would be that the State assumes responsibility for the \ndisused installations. In the American example, some American States have accepted \nresponsibility for certain abandoned platforms. When the relevant agency of these \nStales issues a permit to the owner for disposal at sea it absolves the owners from any \nsubsequent liabilities Industry appears to favour some form of limitation or transfer \nof liability to a state authority. Whether other States would be prepared to do the same \nis not clear. \n4.5.4. Under the existing rules the importance of establishing clearly who is the legal \nowner of any installation disposed of at sea, and who has financial responsibility for it \nhas been recognised. Whether the State or Industry is ultimately responsible is less \nimportant than ensuring that at the time that disposal at sea takes place responsibility \nis clearly established, thereby ensuring the necessary effective protection for users of \nthe sea. \n4.6. Competition and competitiveness \n4.6.1. In theory different standards could lead to problems with competition. The \nNorth Sea is a mature oil and gas province with a stable regulatory regime and the \nadditional costs of a complete removal and disposal on land policy are not material to \nthe investment decision. They arise at the end of an income stream of a number of \nyears and their net present cost at the time of the development decision are negligible. \nIt is therefore unlikely that there would be a serious danger of diverting investment \naway from the North Sea to other regions on cost grounds. \n14", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2926, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13a22a91-48f5-49b0-8fa7-072e080e2939": {"__data__": {"id_": "13a22a91-48f5-49b0-8fa7-072e080e2939", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "474e0ca9-ed8a-4970-9c9d-e9572b68e917", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "949dc769ea502fe436376125f5c26cda5236c12c9415cded38c77ebc83fe36a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1e16b97-828f-4447-b584-ba7837cb73ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3c7aab67847b51646a63ba3fb300e2c708d062e5caf0c4cac1ccf513a67e8b73", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "606ec3b7-e065-4b19-8506-8e2387df9cb6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01541839c328a6746edff74742ed955b070d6a4c03125fd643265274b4673e76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4.6.2.

Within \nOSPAR it is theoretically permilted but the necessary guidelines have not yet been \ndrawn up and agreed. As any guidelines or regulations would apply to all installations, \nregardless of the nationality of the owner, there should be no question of \ndiscrimination against 3rd country corporations. \n5. The Community dimension \n5.1. Disposal of decommissioned offshore installations situated where the Member \nStates exercise jurisdiction is clearly an issue for which the Community can exercise \ncompetence, cf. Article 130r(l) of the EC Treaty. Furthermore, the Community may \nexercise external competence for environmental questions, cf. Article 130r(4) of the \nTrealy and may therefore participate on behalf of the Member States in international \nnegoliations. The scope of the draft OSPAR Decision is both new and existing \ninstallations and it will therefore affect both the known areas where there are existing \ninstallations as well as the as yet unknown areas where any future installations may be \nplaccd. \n5.2. An important environmental challenge posed by decommissioned offshore \ninstallations is their potential to cause pollution by hazardous substances, including oil \nresidues, both from the installations themselves and from associated piles of drill \ncuttings. Other important environmental challenges include substantial amounts of \nmaterials containing natural radioactive substances of low specific activity as well as \nthe management and disposal of the very large amounts of demolition waste from the \n\"physical structures of the installations. Also, the decommissioning issue raises non-\nenvironmental questions concerning the safeguarding of other uses of the sea. \n15", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2993, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "606ec3b7-e065-4b19-8506-8e2387df9cb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "606ec3b7-e065-4b19-8506-8e2387df9cb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4c1348e8-de12-48b1-80e7-8bf096124f2f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e4bb12db09446b05baee97d30b96683a94c524a65fa2265114af354fdce58d80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13a22a91-48f5-49b0-8fa7-072e080e2939", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "d3d7420f98a4c1ab409a8d313a1733b9c7450aa4e846631fa66d9c18d45f9761", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f65edd81-a44a-49ea-a2f3-1f6af0e76536", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30a23ca7c451326a31db4de8ef2ed0a9c36944bfb43b474dcae1fa8033376380", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "5.3. Hazardous and radioactive substances, once released into the marine \nenvironment, be freely transported in the sea across boundaries in aceordanee with \nprevailing currents and meieorological condilions and cause pollution. In this contcxt, \nthe need to remove polJuled driil eu\u00eetings may influenee decisions on the need for \ncomplete removal of installations from the sea bed. The requirement to protect the sea \nagainst such pollution is therefore clearly an international one. Substantial \nCommunity legislation to prevent direct and indirect pollution of the sea by hazardous \nsubstances is alrsady in place. Examples of such important legislation are inter alia \nDirectives 76/464/EEC (discharge of dangerous substances) and 76/769/EEC \n(restrictions on marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations) \nas well as risk asssssment framework laid down in Counci\u00ee Regulation 793/93/EEC \n(risk assessment). Also, the Community has set basic safety standards in the area of \nradiation exposure through Direclive 96/29/EURATOM (basic safety standards).An \nOSPAR Decision on offshore installations cou\u00eed, depending on its contcnl undermine \nsomc of the envircnmental beneilts resu\u00eeting from the impiementation of Community \nlegislation concerning hazardous substances and radioactive exposure. \n5.4. in the area of waste disposal, for hazardous as weli as non-hazardous waste, a \nCommunity poliey and extensive Community legislation is already in place, in \nparticular Directives 75/442/EEC (waste framework) and 91/689/EEC (hazardous \nwaste). The objsctives of the waste legislation include the reduction of risks to the \nenvironment from hazardous waste, the protection of human hea\u00eeth and the \nenvironment against harrnful effects caused by transportation, treatment and dumping \nof waste, and the promoiion of waste recovery with a view to the conservation of \nnatural resources. The waste legislation inter alia prohibits the abandonment of waste, \nrsquirs waste to be treated without using methods which could cause harm to the \nenvironment and without risk to water and require the separation of hazardous waste \nfrom non-hazardous waste and its subsequent safe treatment and disposal. There is \nthus a substantial Comrm.inity interest in ensuring coherence of a future regime for \nremoval and disposal of offshore installations and Community waste po\u00eeicy and \nlegislation. \n5.5. Protection of species and their habitats and conservation of biodiversity is an \narea which requires concerted action by the Member States. The Community has \ntherefore adopted Jegislution in this area, in particular Directives 79/409/EEC (wild \nbirds) and 92/43/EEC (conservation of natural habitats). As measures taken with \nregard to removal and disposal of offshore installations may have effects on species \nand habitats , the disposal of offshore installations is clearly an issue where an \ninternational so\u00eeution is needed. \n5.6. The Study carried out'for the Commission Services showed that if sea \ndisposal is to be carried out, the only generally cost-effective so\u00eeution is to topple \ninstallations at the location where they have been in operation.

Sea disposal might therefore have the effect of unnecessariiy \nexposing marinc life to oil poilution which could, apart from any gcneral delrimental \neffccts of such exposure, also result in the lainling of fish. Sea disposal may therefore \noffset the benefits of Community legislation in the area of protection of species and \nhabitats and may in the future give rise to infringements of this legislation. \nFurthermore, it may impact on the quality of fish caught for human consumption. \n5.7. Safeguarding other human uses of the sea and the seabed is another important \nissue to be taken into acco'unt. An important example of this is ensuring the safety of \nnavigation which is appropriately taken care of internationaliy by the IMO guidelines \non removal of installations. Another important issue is the interaction of removal \ndecisions with the management of fisheries in the open sea which is a competence of \nthe Community under the Common Fishcrics Policy. Clearly, the degree of removal \nof decommissioned offshore installations will inlerfere with the availability of the \narcas concerned for cerlain types of fisheries, with the safety of fishcrmen and will \nincrease the risk of loss of gears and vessels. Measures adoptcd concerning rcmoval \nand disposal of decommissioned offshore installations therefore interfere considerably \nwith the Common Fisheries Policy in particular by interfering with the management \nof arcas available for fishing. \nAlthough the influence of decisions on removal and disposal of offshore installations \non the production price of oil and gas is negligible, there is nevertheless a \nconsiderable Community interest in ensuring that the oil and gas exploration and \nexploitation industry is subjected to the same approach to removal and disposal \nrequirements across the Community thus ensuring that such requirements do not \nbecome a competition factor. \n5.8. In summary, there is a preponderant Community interest in the issue of \nremoval and disposal of disused offshore oil and gas installations. In the \ncnvironmcntal area il is related particularly lo qucslions of poilution with hazardous \nsubstances and low-Ievel radioactive wastes, ha/ardous and non-hazardous wastes, \nconscrvation of biodiversity and protection of species of habitats. In other areas, it is \nparticularly related to the Common Fisheries Policy and to ensuring a common \napproach across the Community to decommissioning requirements and to residual \nliability thus ensuring that these do not become competition factors between Member \nStates. A clear and unambiguous Community policy and implementation will notably \nhelp ensure the uniform application and enforcement of Community policy and \nmeasures in this area both within the same seas and between different seas, and will in \nparticular mitigate the inherent risks of tncompatibilities and unequal treatment which \nmight develop if different approaches are adopted by the different regional seas \nconventions. \nIt is therefore appropriate for the Community to take action concerning the disposal of \noffshore oil and gas installations. It is clear that the objectives in this area cannot be \nsufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved by \nthe Community. \n17", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3473, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce967d39-6d1c-428a-b64e-8256bae9df21": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce967d39-6d1c-428a-b64e-8256bae9df21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6546dc2-e823-4f61-91aa-02599783da3a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "ac8527ad1fd392925a7d91df3ce633a732ccad37b18bc39d49349ea7044b8774", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f65edd81-a44a-49ea-a2f3-1f6af0e76536", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "35f72b5a76ac874d902d75068dbe271108ce64e56a8fc7bfc23d8e777efd16dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0333fe48-8a1c-48ba-a1db-16c6f1f4fbb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba4371fffe2d2a8bcc815944548e3063255110c15f1e1e3ea45630576aa527ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "6.

The disadvantage of this \u00e0pproach is that only EC and \nEEA Member States would be bound to the common \u00e0pproach whereas other third \ncountries with which we'share the Seas concerned would not be bound to implement \nthe same or similar measures without the Community takirig the initiative to negotiate \nand adopt such rules in the relevan\u00ee regional seas Conventions.

Following this communication, and on the basis of Council Conclusions of 16 \nDecember 1997 authorising the Commission to negotiate and vote in the name of the \nCommunity on Decisions under Article 10, para 3 of the OSPAR Convention, the \nCommission will forward to the Council a separate document requesting the Council \nto endorse recommended specific negotiating directives. \n19", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2571, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41586a10-34de-4d72-bdd8-1a6f75fcc0f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "41586a10-34de-4d72-bdd8-1a6f75fcc0f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3f07d52f-725f-4679-9357-0b1965a431be", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "9d81b343a56b944101ee0e1bce3dc5e36fd771d374917f7517140d497aef4365", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0333fe48-8a1c-48ba-a1db-16c6f1f4fbb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\CELEX_51998DC0049_EN_TXT.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1485012, "creation_date": "2024-03-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "102fde84a6968c6df8783e29bff8c2752acd28a6b305447eb7dbd6ea70abc1ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ead62301-4dac-4492-9b86-1f5d6c9c2439", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9671dc1939459d1ed6b21225a36f82f11cdd5135cf70e1e42cdf572c21a90fbb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "7.7.

As well as benefiting\nthe EU\u2019s consumers and workers, it is essential to creating better jobs, building a\ngreener society, and improving our quality of life. It is also key to maintaining the\nEU\u2019s competitiveness on global markets. Innovation policy is the interface between\nresearch and technological development policy and industrial policy and aims to\ncreate a framework conducive to bringing ideas to market.\nLEGAL BASIS\nArticle 173 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which states\nthat \u2018the Union and the Member States shall ensure that the conditions necessary for\nthe competitiveness of the Union\u2019s industry exist\u2019.\nArticles 179 to 190 of the TFEU regulate the Union\u2019s research and technological\ndevelopment (RTD) and space policy. The main instrument of RTD policy is the\nmultiannual framework programme, which defines the objectives, priorities and\nfinancial support package. The RTD framework programmes are adopted by the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council, following the ordinary legislative procedures,\nwith prior consultation of the European Economic and Social Committee.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe importance of innovation policy is widely recognised and it is closely linked to\nother EU policies, such as those on employment, competitiveness, the climate and\nenvironment, industry and energy. The role of innovation is to turn research results\ninto new and better services and products in order to remain competitive in the global\nmarketplace and improve people\u2019s quality of life.\nThe EU spends a smaller percentage of annual GDP (2.3 % in 2020) than the United\nStates (3.45 % in 2020) and Japan (3.26 % in 2020) on research and development\n(R&D). In addition, there is a brain drain effect, as many of the EU\u2019s best researchers\nand innovators move to countries where conditions are more favourable. The EU\nmarket remains fragmented and is not sufficiently innovation friendly. To reverse these\ntrends, the EU developed the concept of an \u2018Innovation Union\u2019, which aimed to:\n\u2014Make the EU a world-class science performer;\n\u2014Remove obstacles to innovation \u2013 like expensive patenting, market fragmentation,\nslow standard-setting and skills shortages \u2013 which prevent ideas getting to market\nquickly;", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2388, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "647deaf8-bd21-4931-8b3f-4d3cc61ae081": {"__data__": {"id_": "647deaf8-bd21-4931-8b3f-4d3cc61ae081", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 304981, "creation_date": "2024-03-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e5066bd-4dd7-4a6e-a084-252a5e2cf21a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 304981, "creation_date": "2024-03-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "30c0a9a21d5a6b7bf83d90574f2806c2e73265ee2f3c232a0914eafe568888e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b32f2e67-2555-4099-a146-a3e5eda8f5b5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 304981, "creation_date": "2024-03-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "dad1147b44dfc5c83cd64324a8aa4df04e7a4fa787ee01d9fbca271dc63d26f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7166d6f5-19bf-434a-99a8-972d1b47aa58", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ea51ebbdf5314a1c975d17e1eb1e2d14e918e8e9db92721e57b803436632f33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Fact Sheets on the European Union - 2024 2\nwww.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en\u2014Revolutionise the way the public and private sectors work together, notably\nthrough the implementation of European innovation partnerships between the EU\ninstitutions, national and regional authorities and business.\nACHIEVEMENTS\nA. Innovation Union\nThe Innovation Union was one of the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020\nstrategy for a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy . Launched by the Commission\nin 2010, it aimed to improve conditions and access to finance for research and\ninnovation in the EU so that innovative ideas could be turned into products and services\nthat drive growth and create jobs. The Innovation Union aimed to create a genuine\nsingle European market for innovation, which would attract innovative companies\nand businesses. To achieve this, various measures were proposed in the fields of\npatent protection, standardisation, public procurement and smart regulation. Several\ninstruments have been introduced to measure and monitor the situation across the EU\nand the progress being made, including:\n\u2014A comprehensive scoreboard for innovation in the EU based on 32 indicators and\na European knowledge market for patents and licensing. The European Innovation\nScoreboard  (EIS) is a Commission instrument developed under the Lisbon\nStrategy to provide a comparative assessment of the innovation performance of\nEU Member States, other European countries, and regional neighbours;\n\u2014A regional innovation scoreboard , which classifies the EU\u2019s regions into\nfour innovation performance groups: \u2018innovation leaders\u2019, \u2018strong innovators\u2019,\n\u2018moderate innovators\u2019 and \u2018emerging innovators\u2019. This provides a more detailed\nmapping of innovation at local level.\nThe Innovation Union also proposed measures to complete the European Research\nArea to ensure better consistency between EU and national research policies, and\nto remove obstacles to researchers\u2019 mobility. In education, the Commission supports\nprojects to develop new curricula addressing innovation skills gaps.\nB. Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe\nAs a Europe 2020 flagship initiative aimed at securing the EU\u2019s global competitiveness,\nHorizon 2020  was the financial instrument supporting the implementation of the\nInnovation Union. Although it was the EU\u2019s eighth framework programme (2014-2020)\nfor research, Horizon 2020 was the first programme to integrate research and\ninnovation, and it enacted many of the specific Innovation Union commitments. In 2013,\nParliament adopted the multiannual financial framework (MFF), allocating Horizon 2020\na budget of EUR 77 billion (at 2013 prices). However, the adoption of the European\nFund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) in 2015 meant that this amount was cut to\nEUR 74.8 billion.\nAn interim evaluation of Horizon 2020 was performed in 2018 and the results were used\nto lay the foundations for the structure and content of the Horizon Europe programme,\nfor which a proposal was published in 2018 .", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3009, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7166d6f5-19bf-434a-99a8-972d1b47aa58": {"__data__": {"id_": "7166d6f5-19bf-434a-99a8-972d1b47aa58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 304981, "creation_date": "2024-03-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2922d05-53a8-41f8-bf0e-742f63d6ec23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 304981, "creation_date": "2024-03-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "07029ed628c664f81363872c7ee4b2641e582e132d0c0ea1885aa187ac1bb6ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "647deaf8-bd21-4931-8b3f-4d3cc61ae081", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 304981, "creation_date": "2024-03-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "30c0a9a21d5a6b7bf83d90574f2806c2e73265ee2f3c232a0914eafe568888e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3e2451d-926a-4bfa-9623-3a635c453471", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7db0a9fd998df8b6131e0de25f229669b93b1d9816fa3dd9b29f07a083e0be4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Fact Sheets on the European Union - 2024 3\nwww.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/enIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Commission presented amended\nproposals for both legal acts in June 2020 to allow additional funding for Horizon Europe\nto be provided by the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) recovery instrument. In July 2020,\nthe European Council agreed on the recovery plan for Europe , which combines the\nMFF for the years 2021-2027 and the funds to be made available through the NGEU.\nThe Horizon Europe  programme was established by Regulation (EU) 2021/695 , which\nlays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021 to 2027,\nthe forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Regarding\nHorizon Europe, a budget allocation of EUR 5.4 billion from the NGEU instrument,\nparticularly to support the green and digital recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, was\neventually agreed. This forms part of the total Horizon Europe budget of EUR 95.5\nbillion for the period from 2021-2027. In 2022, the Commission amended  the Horizon\nEurope work programme 2021-2022, increasing the budget, including the budget for\nWomenTechEU, which supports women-led deep-tech start-ups, and launched other\nactions to boost Europe\u2019s innovation potential.\nC.

In more developed regions,\nat least 85% of resources from the European Regional Development Fund at national\nlevel are allocated to objectives related to innovation, with the 2021-2027 priorities\nbeing investments in a smarter, greener, more connected and more social Europe that\nis closer to its citizens.\nD. Financial instruments\nThe Innovation Union also aimed to stimulate private-sector investment. Therefore,\namong other things, it proposed an increase in EU venture capital investments. In order\nto improve access to loans for R&D projects and launch demonstration projects, the\nCommission, in cooperation with the European Investment Bank Group (the European\nInvestment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund), launched a joint initiative\nunder Horizon 2020. This initiative, \u2018InnovFin \u2013 EU Finance for Innovators\u2019, consisted of\na series of integrated and complementary financing tools and advisory services offered\nby the EIB Group, covering the entire value chain of research and innovation in order\nto support investments from the smallest to the largest enterprises.\nIn addition, in 2014 the Commission proposed its \u2018Investment Plan for Europe\u2019 to\nunlock public and private investments in the \u2018real economy\u2019 to the sum of at least\nEUR 315 billion over a three-year fiscal period.

The European Institute of Innovation and Technology\nThe European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) was established in 2008\nby Regulation (EC) No 294/2008, as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/819 .\nIts overall mission is to increase Europe\u2019s competitiveness, its sustainable economic\ngrowth and job creation by promoting and strengthening cooperation among leading\nbusiness, education and research organisations. It also aims to power innovation and\nentrepreneurship in Europe by fostering environments for creative and innovative ideas\nto thrive. The EIT achieves these objectives mainly through its Innovation Communities,\nwhich bring together more than 1 200 partners from business, research and education\n(the \u2018knowledge triangle\u2019).\nF.Innovation Council\nIn 2017, the Commission created a fifteen-member High-Level Group of Innovators that\nhelped shape the design of the European Innovation Council ( EIC) in the framework\nof the Commission\u2019s proposals for the successor programme to Horizon 2020, Horizon\nEurope. The EIC is the EU\u2019s flagship innovation programme to identify, develop and\nscale up breakthrough, and in particular deep-tech, innovations, and it has a budget of\nEUR 10.1 billion to support them throughout the life cycle from early stage research,\nto proof of concept, technology transfer, and the financing and scale up of start-\nups and SMEs. In 2021, the Commission signed a Memorandum of Understanding\nbetween the EIC and the EIT to strengthen their cooperation to support the best\nEuropean entrepreneurs. In response to the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, the\nCommission set aside EUR 20 million to support Ukrainian start-ups through a targeted\namendment of the 2022 EIC work programme.\nG. European innovation agenda\nIn 2022, the Commission adopted a New European Innovation Agenda , proposing 25\nspecific actions in five flagship areas: funding scale-ups; enabling innovation through\nexperimentation spaces and public procurement; accelerating and strengthening\ninnovation in European innovation ecosystems across the EU; fostering, attracting\nand retaining deep-tech talents; and improving policymaking tools. Its aim is to\nplace Europe in the lead of the new wave of deep-tech innovation, which requires\nbreakthrough R&D combined with substantial capital investment in order to address\npressing societal challenges. In order to continuously develop the strategic aspects of\nthe European Innovation Agenda, the European Sounding Board on Innovation was\ncreated as a platform for advice and for discussions of emerging issues with high-level\nrepresentatives from European academia and industry.\nThe Commission\u2019s 2022 edition of the Science, Research and Innovation Performance\n(SRIP) report  also focuses on the EU\u2019s innovation performance in a global context and\nsuggests measures to address issues such as the difficulty of attracting and retaining\ntalent.\nROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nParliament has adopted a number of resolutions to bolster the EU\u2019s innovation policy,\nincluding the following:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3128, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5e76896-2762-4b33-b649-95be82a9a5c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5e76896-2762-4b33-b649-95be82a9a5c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 304981, "creation_date": "2024-03-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee00b677-f957-4546-a296-b41977541e9d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 304981, "creation_date": "2024-03-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "628b846f3254d320db12ec70fa5c3cefc20cb59730cac72a44053d32be207e44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3e2451d-926a-4bfa-9623-3a635c453471", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\_FAIR\\PROTO\\sources\\FTU_2.4.6.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 304981, "creation_date": "2024-03-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "3d4e22241952f8f5eba91e6f2adde4965995283764ff8ff1fc920bc2f4faf2e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Fact Sheets on the European Union - 2024 5\nwww.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en\u2014Resolution of 16 June 2010 on the EU 2020 strategy .
